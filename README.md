# Office Boy Online Feature Documentation #

**Introduction**

The Office Boy Online feature enhances the functionality of the application by providing real-time tracking and management capabilities for office boys responsible for handling deliveries. This feature streamlines the delivery process, improves efficiency, and provides better visibility into order fulfillment.

**Key Features**

1. **Real-time Tracking**: Office Boy Online enables real-time tracking of office boys' order status, allowing users to monitor their progress throughout the delivery process.

2. **Status Updates**: Users can receive instant updates on order status changes, such as pickup, en route, and delivery completed, providing transparency and accountability.

3. **Task Assignment**: Orders are dynamically assigned to available office boys based on criteria such as proximity to pickup locations and current shift.

**How It Works**

1. **Office Boy App**: Office boys use a dedicated mobile application to manage their tasks, view assigned orders, navigate to pickup and delivery locations, and update order statuses in real-time.

2. **Order Assignment**: When a new order is placed, the system assigns it to an available office boy based on predefined criteria such as proximity to the pickup location and current shift schedule.

3. **Order Updates**: Office boys update the order status in the app as they progress through various stages of the delivery process, keeping customers and administrators informed.

4. **Order Editing**: Once an order is delivered, office boys can view the assigned order and edit its payment status (whether it is paid or not). This feature provides flexibility in managing order payments directly from the delivery location.
